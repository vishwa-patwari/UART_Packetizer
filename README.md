# UART_Packetizer
UART Packetizer with FSM and FIFO Integration  This project implements a UART Packetizer in Verilog that accepts 8-bit parallel data, buffers it using a FIFO, organizes packets via an FSM, and serializes them with a UART transmitter. The design is modular, reusable, and verified using Vivado.
